VideOSC is an experimental OSC controller for Android that uses the color information coming from the device' in-built camera(s) to control the generation of electronic sounds or other media.
This repository is a complete rewrite of the app's first version (written using Processing, a Java-based programming environment for creative coding). The repository contains new features as well as it's focusing on stability (e.g. avoiding memory leaks) and enhanced user experience.
